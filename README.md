# Cellular Forms

A reproduction of [Andy Lomas](https://andylomas.com/)'s "Cellular Forms" work in Unity.

## v0.5 Bulge "Force" and Random Cell Division

Failed attempt as cell division. The child cell and parent cell are not sharing linked cells in a nice way, it turns into spaghetti. Lol. Need to learn "vertex split" algorithm and Half-edge data structure etc. first.

## v0.4: Planar "force"

Spring "force" was pushing or pulling linked cells to spring's rest length. Planar force pushes a cell towards to center of mass of linked cells. It'll iron out the wrinkles and flatten out surfaces.

Playing with the weight of each force moves cells to different equilibrium points.
