# Cellular Forms

A reproduction of [Andy Lomas](https://andylomas.com/)'s "Cellular Forms" work in Unity.

## v0.4: Planar "force"

Spring "force" was pushing or pulling linked cells to spring's rest length. Planar force pushes a cell towards to center of mass of linked cells. It'll iron out the wrinkles and flatten out surfaces.

Playing with the weight of each force moves cells to different equilibrium points.
